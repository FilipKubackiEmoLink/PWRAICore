    "## 📓 Notebooks: Enabling Interactive `tqdm` Progress Bars\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in Jupyter notebooks, you'll want to see clean, interactive progress bars for long-running tasks. However, the standard setup can lead to a couple of common problems. This guide shows you the professional way to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You might run into one of two issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Messy, multi-line output:** Using the standard `from tqdm import tqdm` will print a new progress bar on every update, flooding your output cell.\n",
    "2.  **An `ImportError`:** Following the best practice of using `from tqdm.notebook import tqdm` might give you this error:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ImportError: IProgress not found. Please update jupyter and ipywidgets.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because the beautiful, interactive notebook widgets require a special library (`ipywidgets`) and a Jupyter extension that aren't installed by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Install and Enable `ipywidgets`\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps in your terminal at the root of the project to permanently fix this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Add `ipywidgets` as a Dev Dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ipywidgets` library is a tool for your development environment, not a core dependency of the final application. We'll use the `--dev` flag to add it correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rye add --dev ipywidgets\n",
    "rye sync\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Enable the Jupyter Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing the package isn't enough. You need to tell Jupyter to activate its interactive components. We use rye run to ensure the command executes within our project's managed environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rye run jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Restart Your Jupyter Kernel! 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most important step! Your currently running notebook doesn't know about the new extension yet.\n",
    "In your notebook interface (e.g., VS Code or Jupyter Lab), click Kernel > Restart Kernel."

    "## 📂 Phase 2a: Data Preparation - Unzipping the Archives\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can analyze the financial documents, we need to extract them from their compressed archives. This section details the initial data preparation script which unzips all the source files and creates a master index for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The source data is provided as a directory full of `.zip` files. Each zip file is named after a company's KRS number (e.g., `0000001132.zip`) and contains one or more financial documents for that company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this script is to:\n",
    "1.  Scan a specified directory for all `.zip` archives.\n",
    "2.  Unzip each archive into its own dedicated folder to keep the data organized.\n",
    "3.  Create a comprehensive JSON lookup map, `file_map.json`, that connects each KRS number to the list of all file paths that were extracted for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Script Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The script (`your_script_name.py`) performs the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sets the Source Path:** It starts with a `Path` variable that you must configure to point to your data directory:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ZIP_DATA_PATH = Path(\"/path/to/your/zip/files-directory/\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Scans for Zips:** It walks through the `ZIP_DATA_PATH` and identifies all files ending with `.zip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Extracts in a Loop:** It iterates through each zip file one by one. For a file named `0000001132.zip`, it will:\n",
    "    *   Create a new directory named `0000001132/` in the same location.\n",
    "    *   Extract all the contents of the zip file into this new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Builds the Map:** During the loop, it constructs a Python dictionary. The key is the KRS number (derived from the zip filename, e.g., `\"0000001132\"`), and the value is a list of the full paths to every file that was just extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Saves the Output:** Once all zip files have been processed, the script saves the entire dictionary to a file named `file_map.json` in the project's root directory. This JSON file will be the primary input for the next phase of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Performance Enhancement: A Task for You! (TODO)\n",
    "\n",
    "The current script processes the zip files sequentially, one after another. This is simple and reliable, but it can be slow if you have hundreds or thousands of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task—unzipping files—is what's known as an **\"embarrassingly parallel\" problem**. Each zip file can be processed completely independently of the others. This makes it a perfect candidate for **multiprocessing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Challenge:**\n",
    "Refactor the `unzip_and_map_files` function to use Python's `multiprocessing` module (specifically, a `Pool` of workers) to unzip the files in parallel. This will dramatically speed up the data preparation step, especially on multi-core machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "*   You'll want to use `Pool.map()` or `Pool.imap_unordered()`.\n",
    "*   The function that the pool executes should handle a single zip file (`_unzip_single_file` is already a great starting point).\n",
    "*   Think about how you will collect the results from all the parallel processes to build the final `directory_file_map` dictionary."

    "### The `multiprocessing` and `lambda` Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pitfall in Python's `multiprocessing` is the `AttributeError: Can't get local object '<locals>.<lambda>'`. This error occurs when you try to pass a `lambda` function to a worker pool. Here is the compact explanation of why this happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"Why\" in one sentence:** A `lambda` function cannot be sent to another process because it is **anonymous** and **local**; a worker process needs a **named, top-level function** that it can reliably import and find.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Core Problem: Process Isolation & Pickling\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Separate Processes:** `multiprocessing` creates brand-new, isolated processes with their own memory. They do not share local variables with the main process.\n",
    "2.  **Sending Instructions:** To send a task to a worker process, Python must **serialize** (or \"pickle\") the function and its arguments into a byte stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `lambda` vs. `def`: The Pickling Test\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the two types of functions fundamentally differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Characteristic | `lambda` (Inside a function) | `def` (Top-Level Function) |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Analogy** | A temporary \"sticky note\" | A named \"book\" in a library |\n",
    "| **Scope** | Local & Anonymous | Global & Named |\n",
    "| **Picklable?** | ❌ **No** | ✅ **Yes** |\n",
    "| **Reason** | The worker process receives instructions to find a nameless, local \"sticky note\" that doesn't exist in its own separate memory space. | The worker process is told to \"import the `module` and find the function named `unzip_worker`,\" which is a reliable, findable address. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Error Message Decoded\n",
    "\n",
    "The error `AttributeError: Can't get local object ... <lambda>` is Python's direct way of saying: \"I was sent to a new process and told to find this local, anonymous function, but it doesn't exist here.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Golden Rule:** When using `multiprocessing`, any function passed as a task to a worker **must be a named function defined at the top level of a module**."
