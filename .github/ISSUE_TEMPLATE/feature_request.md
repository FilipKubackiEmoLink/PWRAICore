about: "Suggest an idea for a new feature or enhancement."

title: "[Feature]: A brief, descriptive title"

labels: ["enhancement", "needs-triage"]

---

### **1. The Problem**
*Tell us why this feature is needed. What pain point or limitation does it address?*

A clear and concise description of the problem. For example: "As a data analyst, it is currently difficult to export reports in CSV format, which slows down my workflow."

---

### **2. The Proposed Solution**
*Describe how the feature should work from a user's perspective. What is the ideal outcome?*

A detailed description of the desired functionality. For example: "Add a new 'Export to CSV' button on the main dashboard. When clicked, it should generate a CSV file of the current view and trigger a download."

---

### **3. Alternatives Considered**
*What other ways could this be solved? Why is your proposed solution the best approach?*

A brief description of any alternative solutions you've considered. For example: "We considered adding an email-based reporting system, but a direct download is faster and more aligned with user expectations."

---

### **4. Additional Context**
*Add any mockups, screenshots, diagrams, reference links, or other context that helps explain your idea.*

You can drag and drop images or paste links here. This is the place for visual aids that clarify the request.

---

### **5. Technical Implementation (Optional)**
*If you have suggestions for the code, mention them here. Think about affected modules, API changes, or new dependencies.*

This section is for developers to outline a potential implementation strategy. For example: "This could be implemented in the `ReportGenerator` service and would require adding the `pandas` library to handle CSV creation."
